2012-09-26 02:30  New picasaweb support

picasaweb.py assumes that gdata-2.0.17 (or similar)
 Google Data API python library is accessible.
E.g.
  export PYTHONPATH=.:~+/gdata-2.0.17/src

20090830: Turn the OLPC XO into a wifi enabled Picture Frame

Turning the XO into a picture frame that uses the network to get a copy of the pictures to display.

* The following features are wanted
  1. Be able to easily update the pictures over the net.
    Be able to use a source like Picasa, PicasaWeb, iPhoto,...
    Not more complicated than an "Export into a folder".
  2. Allow working without a web connection.
    If the net goes down, it still must display the pictures (implies some form of caching).
  3. Have simple controls on the frame itself.
    next/prev/pause, re-grab, ...
  4. Allow source of pics to control slideshow params.
    Works by dropping a config file within the export-folder.
  5. slideshow should start automatically at boot up.

* Implementation Notes
  - Not using Picasa. It would have allowed grabbing albums from picasaweb, but does not work OOB.
     . missing libs
        2009-08-30 http://dl.google.com/linux/rpm/testing/i386/picasa-3.0-current.i386.rpm would fail to install due to missing libs.
     . no working album download feature
        http://dl.google.com/linux/rpm/stable/i386/picasa-2.7.3736-15.i386.rpm does not have importing from picasaweb built-in
        and the firefox activity does not recognize the installed picasa, so downloading web albums does not work.

  - Using feh (http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/), a command-line picture viewer
    . yum install feh
    . sample commandline:
      feh --info 'echo some title' --recursive --hide-pointer --full-screen --auto-zoom --preload --slideshow-delay=3 --reload=30 pics/

  - Start up a webserver on the machine that holds the pictures
    . On my MacMini
      Enable the webserver for my main user.
      The export folder for picasa now lives under /Users/jpa/sites/pics/...

  - Other changes
    . Re-use the "WIFI connection" script from this notebook
      Modified to retry getting the connection after it has gone away using something similar to crystal2464.wifi.sh
      Call the modified wifi connection script and background it from /etc/rc.local
    . Create a "slideshow" script that
      wget's the slideshow.config + pics/* from the image server
      starts up feh with the wanted slideshow delay in the background
      monitors the image server for changes

     . Launch the slideshow script from /home/olpc/.xsession
       ( echo "Let the olpc display manager start up" ; sleep 60; exec /home/olpc/slideshow ) &
